# RandRunner

This the project page for the RandRunner protocol, a new distributed protocol 
for generating publicly-verifiable randomness in a distributed fashion. This work is a joint research project by my team members Aljosha Judmayer, Markus Hittmeir,  Nicholas Stifter and myself, conducted at SBA Research, TU Wien and Universit√§t Wien, under the supervision of Prof. Edgar Weippl.

The corresponding research paper **"RandRunner: Distributed Randomness from Trapdoor VDFs with Strong Uniqueness"** was accepted at the NDSS Symposium 2021. We thank all anonymous reviewers and our shepard for the valuable feedback we received.
The full paper is available online at https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/ndss2021_3C-2_24116_paper.pdf.
Let us know if you are interested, have feedback or questions.

## Research Artifacts

As part of RandRunner's evaluation, we simulated the execution of the protocol 
considering a broad range of different parameterizations and scenarios.
The source code and results of these simulations are available as a [Jupyter notebook](RandRunnerSimulations.ipynb).
