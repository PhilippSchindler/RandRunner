# RandRunner

This the project page for the RandRunner protocol, a new distributed protocol 
for generating publicly-verifiable randomness in a distributed fashion. This work is a joint research project by my team members Aljosha Judmayer, Markus Hittmeir,  Nicholas Stifter and myself, conducted at SBA Research, TU Wien and Universit√§t Wien, under the supervision of Prof. Edgar Weippl.

The corresponding research paper *"RandRunner: Distributed Randomness from Trapdoor VDFs with Strong Uniqueness"* is currently in the reviewing process.
A preprint of the work is available online at https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/942.pdf.
Let us know if you are interested, have feedback or questions.

## Research Artifacts

As part of RandRunner's evaluation, we simulated the execution of the protocol 
considering a broad range of different parameterizations and scenarios.
We are currently in the process of preparing the source code and results for presentation on this page. We will update this page accordingly as soon as we finish this process.
